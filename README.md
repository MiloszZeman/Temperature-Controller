# Temperature Controller
 
A hobby project. The source code for a two-state temperature controller based on AtMega. The project was created in Microchip Studio. It works with use of RTC module and DS18B20 thermomter. There are I2C and OneWire interfaces used.

Here is the photo of a working prototype designed and made by myself.
